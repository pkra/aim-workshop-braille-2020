# Document structure

# We explicity kill the <head>, which is empty anyway,

# We should not ever see <script> or <style>, but

############
# Paragraphs
############

# PreTeXt logical paragraphs get exploded into multiple
# HTML "p" to meet the requirements of HTML syntax.
# The breaks are dictated by displays, such as lists
# and mathematical displays.  We mark the "new", or
# "subsequent", paragraphs as a continuation.  So for
# Braille we do not indent these.

# Nemeth Math Indicators
########################

# Nemeth indicator use described in:
# Braille Authority of North America (BANA),
# "Guidance for Transcription Using the Nemeth
# Code within UEB Contexts Revised", April 2018
# Hereafter "BANA Nemeth Guidance"
#
# BANA Nemeth Guidance quotes "Rules of Unified English Braille 2013"
#
# 14.6 Nemeth Code within UEB text
#
# 14.6.1 When technical material is transcribed according to the
# provisions of The Nemeth Braille Code for Mathematics and Science
# Notation within UEB text, the following sections provide for
# switching between UEB and Nemeth Code.
#
# 14.6.2 Place the opening Nemeth Code indicator followed by a
# space before the sequence to which it applies. Its effect is
# terminated by the Nemeth Code terminator preceded by a space.
# Note: The spaces required with the indicator and the terminator
# do not represent spaces in print.
#
# 14.6.3 When the Nemeth Code text is displayed on one or more lines
# separate from the UEB text, the opening Nemeth Code indicator and
# the Nemeth Code terminator may each be placed on a line by itself
# or at the end of the previous line of text.
#
# Opening Nemeth Code indicator
# _%,  4-5-6 1-4-6,  x5f x25
# always followed by a space
# technically a UEB symbol
#
# Nemeth Code terminator
# _:,  4-5-6 1-5-6,  x5f x3a
# always preceded by a space
# technically a Nemeth symbol

# We use a "mjx-container" tag as we produce Braille
# with the Speech Rule Engine.  We wrap it with
# the right indicators.  The spaces here are
# "non-breaking", which  liblouis  respects,
# and then converts to plain (x20) spaces.
# TODO add example; subject to change

# Blocks

# this will make liblouis insert runs of identical characters
# across the width of the text, just prior, and just
# after, to create a "box".

#######
# Lists
#######

# There are lists and then there are list items.  We want
# a simple list, or the outermost list of a set of nested
# lists, to always have a blank line before and after, so
# we give thos a style based on a class value, the others
# just get dropped as pure containers.  There is only one
# kind of list item.

#TODO PKRA: how can we precede them with a marker?

# Tables

# Table entries end with a semi-colon,
# and a space to separate.
# Table rows ends with a period.
